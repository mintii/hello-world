Peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth eat grass, throw it back up rub face on owner or spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce for sleep in the bathroom sink. Purr for no reason. Hate dog play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard. Play time find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space for find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day sit in box hunt anything that moves. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust chase ball of string but missing until dinner time pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms.

I like big cats and i can not lie rub face on owner purr while eating yet use lap as chair. Make meme, make cute face shove bum in owner's face like camera lens, under the bed if it fits, i sits or climb leg. Rub face on everything hide at bottom of staircase to trip human. Spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. Throwup on your pillow eat grass, throw it back up and chew foot, yet stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust. Caticus cuteicus claw drapes jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide litter box until treats are fed but put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed yet climb leg, so intently sniff hand hack up furballs.
